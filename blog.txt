Excerpt:
For decades, marketers relied on gut instinct and trend-following. But with modern AI-generated assets, we can optimize color, layout, and contrast on a per-demographic basis. Warm tones work for impulse buys. Cool tones for tech. Contrast drives clickthroughs. These aren’t opinions—they’re patterns extracted from thousands of high-performing campaigns.

In this post, we explore how automated tools like Reflexion create variant-rich visual tests using simple inputs: a product photo, a landing page, or even just a mood. Our color strategy engine isn’t painting by numbers—it’s predicting by pulse.
